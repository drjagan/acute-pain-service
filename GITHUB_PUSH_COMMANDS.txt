# Commands to Push v1.0.0 to GitHub

## Step 1: Add GitHub as Remote Repository

Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username:

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/acute-pain-service.git

# Or if using SSH:
# git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/acute-pain-service.git


## Step 2: Verify Remote was Added

git remote -v


## Step 3: Push Main Branch with Tags

git push -u origin main
git push origin v1.0.0


## Step 4: Verify on GitHub

Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/acute-pain-service
- Check that all files are present
- Verify the v1.0.0 tag appears under "Releases"
- Review the commit history


## Alternative: Push All Branches and Tags at Once

git push -u origin --all
git push origin --tags


## If You Get Authentication Errors:

### For HTTPS (Personal Access Token Required):
1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens
2. Generate new token with 'repo' scope
3. Use token as password when prompted

### For SSH:
1. Set up SSH key: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
2. Use SSH URL instead of HTTPS


## Common Issues:

### "Repository not found"
- Make sure you created the repository on GitHub first
- Check the repository name matches exactly
- Verify you have access to the repository

### "Permission denied"
- Make sure you're logged in to the correct GitHub account
- For HTTPS: Use personal access token as password
- For SSH: Ensure SSH key is added to your GitHub account

### "Remote origin already exists"
- Remove old remote: git remote remove origin
- Add new remote: git remote add origin [URL]
